                <p>In SCAN disk scheduling algorithm, head starts from one end of the disk and moves towards the other
                    end, servicing requests in between one by one and reach the other end. Then the direction of the
                    head is reversed and the process continues as head continuously scan back and forth to access the
                    disk. So, this algorithm works as an elevator and hence also known as the elevator algorithm. As a
                    result, the requests at the midrange are serviced more and those arriving behind the disk arm will
                    have to wait.</p>

                <h3>Advantages of SCAN algorithm </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> This algorithm is simple and easy to understand.</li>
                    <li> SCAN algorithm have no starvation.</li>
                    <li> This algorithm is better than FCFS Scheduling algorithm . </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Disadvantages of SCAN algorithm </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> More complex algorithm to implement.</li>
                    <li> This algorithm is not fair because it cause long waiting time for the cylinders just visited by
                        the head.</li>
                    <li> It causes the head to move till the end of the disk in this way the requests arriving ahead of
                        the arm position would get immediate service but some other requests that arrive behind the arm
                        position will have to wait for the request to complete.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Algorithm: </h3>
                <ol>
                    <li> Let Request array represents an array storing indexes of tracks that have been requested in
                        ascending order of their time of arrival. ‘head’ is the position of disk head.</li>
                    <li> Let direction represents whether the head is moving towards left or right.</li>
                    <li> In the direction in which head is moving service all tracks one by one.</li>
                    <li> Calculate the absolute distance of the track from the head.</li>
                    <li> Increment the total seek count with this distance.</li>
                    <li> Currently serviced track position now becomes the new head position.</li>
                    <li> Go to step 3 until we reach at one of the ends of the disk.</li>
                    <li> If we reach at the end of the disk reverse the direction and go to step 2 until all tracks in
                        request array have not been serviced.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Example: </h3>
                <h4>Input: </h4>
                <p>Request sequence = {176, 79, 34, 60, 92, 11, 41, 114}</p>
                <p>Initial head position = 50</p>
                <p>Direction = left (We are moving from right to left)</p>

                <h4>Output: </h4>
                <p>Total number of seek operations = 226</p>
                <p>Seek Sequence is</p>

                <div class="array">
                    <p class="numbers">41</p>
                    <p class="numbers">34</p>
                    <p class="numbers">11</p>
                    <p class="numbers">0</p>
                    <p class="numbers">60</p>
                    <p class="numbers">79</p>
                    <p class="numbers">92</p>
                    <p class="numbers">114</p>
                    <p class="numbers">176</p>

                <img src="./Graph.jpg" alt="">
                <p>Therefore, the total seek count is calculated as:
                <p>= (50-41)+(41-34)+(34-11)
                    +(11-0)+(60-0)+(79-60)
                    +(92-79)+(114-92)+(176-114)</p>

                <p>= 226 </p>
