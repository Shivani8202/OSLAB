                    Magnetic disks provide the bulk of secondary storage for modern computer systems.
                    Each disk <b>platter</b> has a flat circular shape, like a CD. Common platter diameters range from
                    1.8 to 5.25 inches. The two surfaces of a platter are covered with a magnetic material. We store
                    information by recording it magnetically on the platters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <b>read-write head</b> "flies" just above each surface of every platter. The heads are
                    attached to a <b>disk arm</b>, which moves all the heads as a unit. The surface of a platter is
                    logically divided into circular <b>tracks</b>, which are subdivided into <b>sectors</b>. The set of
                    tracks that
                    are at one arm position forms a <b>cylinder</b>. There may be thousands of concentric cylinders in a
                    disk drive, and each track may contain hundreds of sectors. The storage capacity of common
                    disk drives is measured in gigabytes.

                <h3>Structure of Magnetic disks (Hard disk drive)</h3>
                <p>
                    When the disk is in use, a drive motor spins it at high speed. Most drives rotate 60 to
                    200 times per second. Disk speed has two parts. The <b>transfer rate</b> is the rate at which data
                    flow between the drive and the computer. The <b>positioning time (or random-access time)</b>
                    consists of <b>seek time</b> and <b>rotational latency</b>. The <b>seek time</b> is the time to move
                    the disk arm
                    to the desired cylinder. And the <b>rotational latency</b> is the time for the desired sector to
                    rotate
                    to the disk head. Typical disks can transfer several megabytes of data per second and they
                    have seek times and rotational latencies of several milliseconds.
                </p>

                <p>
                <h3>Capacity of Magnetic disks(C) = S x T x P x N</h3>
                <h5>Where,<br> S = no. of surfaces = 2 x no. of disks, <br>T = no. of tracks in a surface,
                    <br>P = no. of sectors per track,<br> N = size of each sector
                </h5>
                <h3>Transfer Time: T = b / (r x N)</h3>
                <h5>The transfer time to or from the disk depends on the rotation speed of the
                    disk in the following fashion:<br>
                    Where, T = transfer time,<br> b =number of bytes to be transferred,<br> N = number of bytes on a
                    track,<br>
                    r = rotation speed, in revolutions per second.</h5>

                Modern disk drives are addressed as large one-dimensional arrays of logical blocks,
                where the <b>logical block</b> is the smallest unit of transfer. The one-dimensional array of logical
                blocks is mapped onto the sectors of the disk sequentially. Sector 0 is the first sector of the
                first track on the outermost cylinder. The mapping proceeds in order through that track, then
                through the rest of the tracks in that cylinder, and then through the rest of the cylinders from
                outermost to innermost.
                <br><br>
                By using this mapping, we can convert a logical block number into an old-style disk
                address that consists of a cylinder number, a track number within that cylinder, and a sector
                number within that track. In practical, it is difficult to perform this translation, for two
                reasons. First, most disks have some defective sectors, but the mapping hides this by
                substituting spare sectors from elsewhere on the disk. Second, the number of sectors per track
                is not a constant on some drives.
                <br><br>
                The density of bits per track is uniform. This is called <b>Constant linear velocity (CLV)</b>.
                The disk rotation speed can stay constant and the density of bits decreases from inner tracks
                to outer tracks to keep the data rate constant. This method is used in hard disks and is known
                as <b>constant angular velocity (CAV)</b>.
                <br>
                <h3>Disk Scheduling</h3>
                The <b>seek time</b> is the time for the disk arm to move the heads to the cylinder containing
                the desired sector. The <b>rotational latency</b> is the time waiting for the disk to rotate the desired
                sector to the disk head. The <b>disk bandwidth</b> is the total number of bytes transferred divided
                by the total time between the first request for service and the completion of the last transfer.
                <br><br>
                We can improve both the access time and the bandwidth by scheduling the servicing of
                disk I/O requests in a good order. Several algorithms exist to schedule the servicing of disk
                I/O requests as follows:
